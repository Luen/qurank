<b>INTRODUCTION<br>
</b>This page is dedicated to four areas, three of which are accessed from the south end of the James Cook University ring-road. These three areas are Shepherds Crook, University Wall and a bouldering area. The fourth area is Lazy Afternoon Wall and is located 3km from the Uni.<br>
<br>
<b>DISCLAIMER</b></p>

<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">To climb at these areas without possible trespassing, relevant permission may be required. It's your choice whether you obtain permission or not.<br>
<br>
<b>INITIAL ACCESS</b></p>

<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">This does not apply to Lazy Afternoon Wall. At the top / south / furthest from the sea end of the JCU ring-road there is a dirt 4WD track leading in (toward the SW). Take this SW and then take the next obvious left turn (facing SE, or toward Mt Stuart) until you stumble across the main creek bed (obvious). It should take about 5-8 minutes of walking to get from the bitumen road to this creek. This is the starting point from which all area-specific directions will be given.</p>

      </a></b></font>The start of the walk up to Shepherds Crook and University Wall is up the obvious washed out, boulder-filled creek. Steve Baskerville and Jason Shaw have done quite a bit of bouldering in this creek area in 1997 and 1998, and have established some nice problems.
      <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;
      <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">To get to the decent area with good-sized boulders, walk up the creek for about 15-18 minutes. You'll pass small (3-4m high) walls on the way, and will eventually come across one large boulder on the right of the creek bed (pictured right). This signals the start of the good area. This boulder has two great problems and a project on it.

</a><br>
This slabby mini-cliff was discovered by Steve Baskerville and Jason Shaw when they were too lazy to bother walking all the way up to Shepherds Crook. The wall is about 40m long and 15m at its highest, and the middle section of the wall features an overhang. In many ways, the area is quite similar to Kissing Point. For those that don't know Kissing Point, this means easy, slabby and a bit chossy. Stars are given to the better climbs and are relative.<br>
<br>
Upon arriving at the creek bed, follow it upwards for 10-15 mins (i.e. not as far as the bouldering area) passing one major R-hand branch (at about 5 mins) until you reach the second, major R-hand branch. Follow this R-hand branch of the creekbed for 10 mins until you see a black and orange wall up to the R. Walk steeply up the 70m or so to the base (5 mins). At the far R end of the wall there is a small detached pinnacle. Here is the first climb. Most of the routes have their starts marked with an orange arrow.<br>
<br>
<b>Off Campus 6m 15</b><br>
No pro. Starts on the front of the pinnacle, about 0.5m L of the R arête. A bouldery low section to a cruisy slab top out.<br>

On Townsville's 1:100000 map #8259 it is closest to the co-ordinates 74,60.
      This area is gained by a ~1.5 hour walk uphill from the south end of the JCU ring-road. It is a slog, don't go on a hot day. If you are visiting Townsville, go to Mt Stuart instead, this is a spread out, difficult, and often unenjoyable area, but new routes are there for those who seek them...</td>

<p align="left">In early 1997, Matt Russell and Lee Skidmore walked up to the wall to check out climbing possibilities, but with no bolting gear available and the all-natural routes looking too easy, the area was put aside for later. It took until late 1998 for Lee to return to the area with a drill and cleaning gear.&nbsp;</p>

The rock? - volcanic, bubbly, pocketed, highly-featured and very frictional. Very different for Townsville. There is an undercut bouldering area with a couple of steepo problems. There are a handful of beginner-moderate routes, most of which are quite nice. Perfect for a lazy afternoons climbing, or for Uni students with bikes. Because the rock is sharp and rough, take padding for top anchors. Trees are located a long way back from top of wall, so take some long setup gear. The wall faces NNE so gets shade in the mid-late afternoon.</td>

      </b>First top-roped in the rain. Starts on ground level 2m R of SW beneath base of short corner-crack. Up to ledge then easily up corner to break. Pull directly up overhung face to big pocket (#5
      camalot, or go without), then undercling and reach high to clip FH. Move R-wards to traverse lip of cave a few moves, heelhook and rockover L, and pull up onto slab. Up short slab (no pro) to finish.<br>

      </b>Located off the main wall, about 9m R of NBN. Climb very easy corner-crack to base of pillar. Move L under pillar until able to latch jug and clip bolt. Pull onto the pillar (crux), where a few cranks give a rest. Easily to the top. Easy tree belay.<br>

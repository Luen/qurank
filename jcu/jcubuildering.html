<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">University students who are also climbers are faced with a tricky dilemma. They must study to pass their exams, and yet they must also climb, so they do not die. This guide was produced by one such student who found that the University itself can offer a wealth of buildering to the study-enslaved-climbing-deprived.</p>

<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">NOTE: The best time to builder is night so you can avoid security guards, but anyway, they don't care too much. Be nice to them.</p>

Descriptions often state 'numbers of bricks' as reference points. This relates to the number of brick rows from the ground.</p>

<b>** Thin City 4m V2<br>
</b>Facing Ankle Breaker, walk 9 paces right, following rock garden skirting the wall, to come across another convex wall. Handholds 1,2 and 3 on this problem are marked with small black numbers. Start with
L-hand 8 bricks up and Rand 9 bricks up. Tricky big move up and right gives Rand
hold #3, 14 bricks up. From here continue up to 19 bricks up below the bottom left of the window (current finishing point) or continue if your balls are brass.<br>

<b>** National Security 4-5m V0+<br>
</b>So named because I got surprised by an inquisitive security guard after the FA. Located 30m away from previous problems. From the intersection in the commerce rock wall (see the map), walk 12 paces to the set of Admin block windows on the convex wall. Start with both feet on concrete sill of lowest window. Grab edges above window and do a high step with the
L-foot to the obvious hold. Rock onto this and stand up. Now the going is straightforward, directly up the crimps. Current finish is 21 bricks up (level with top of second window) and that was done without a spotter or sketch pad. With these you may wish to take it to 23 bricks.<br>

<br>
<b>* Window Shopping 3-4m V1<br>
</b>Similar to Dirty Slap, but harder and with more moves. Requires good footwork. From the intersection in the commerce rock wall (see the map), walk 12 paces to the set of Admin block windows on the convex wall. Start left foot on concrete sill of lowest window. Work up and right on small crimps. Finishing point is touching the top concrete mounting of the second window up, as for Dirty Slap. Usage of window allowed.<br>

straight ahead (commerce) turn right and enter the undercover area. This place is lit at night and has snack and drink machines. Problems are listed from left to right as you face them.<br>

<b>* The "Corrosive" Dyno</b><br>
Fun. Found outside door of HA002 room. Hang off stair landing between cupboard and stairs with feet smearing vertical concrete. From this position, do a massive one-arm throw to the top of the black railing. The grade is kinda dependant on your height. Has now been done double handed (22/5/98) at about V1.<br>

Now grab wooden lip (body fully stretched) and cut away (or do it static) and climb over railing.<br>

Get situated beneath roof and reach around it and up to grab the top of the building. This is the current finishing point. Climbing onto the top of the building will add danger and grades.<br>

The library has various problems on it, many you can make up as you walk around it. One cool wall is located on the back side of the library closest to TESAG. The 3m high wall forms the railing for a flight of small steps and is lit by a massive spotlight at night. A couple of problems have been done here (up to about V4) by Doug Hockly (22/5/98) and all finish by latching the top.</p>

<br>
<b>Doug's Traverse 6m V5<br>
</b>Starts on the ar�te in the doorway of pizza hut and traverses the length of the wall to finish by reaching around the far right
ar�te.<br>
Done in two sections by Doug Hockly on 22/5/98. It needs to be linked by someone
to make the V5.

There is a good warm up wall on Biological Sciences. Facing Doug's traverse, turn left and walk
towards the library until path ends. Turn left again to find convex, rough wall. Lots of pinch-grips there!

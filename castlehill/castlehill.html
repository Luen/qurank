<b>WHERE IS IT?</b></p>

<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Castle Hill is the huge great lump of coarse monzogranite lying right in the centre of the city! Its peak is 286m above sea level. On Townsville's 1:100000 map #8259 it is closest to the co-ordinates 79,70. If you can't find this, you are not in the right city. As Townsville's map shows, there is a tourist drive that runs up to the top of the 'hill'. Drive up this to access the lower car park before the peak of the hill and the tourist lookout.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><b>THE CLIMBING</b>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">The climbing is very interesting on Castle Hill - completely different to Mt Stuart. It's not as good as Mt Stuart's classic style, but it should be experienced. There aren't that many routes here in comparison to Mt Stuart, but many lines are unmarked and were done
      back in the days of yore with little or no protection. On this page I will only discuss the routes I have seen or climbed myself. There are definitely more I don't know about.&nbsp;Some
old routes have painted initials but their real names are lost in the mists of
time. Therefore in this version of the guide, I have re-named them.</p>
      <p>There several actual multi-pitch routes and many shorter, one pitch routes around. The routes generally ascend very coarse, large grained, crystalline pink granite. Chossy in places, but okay overall. Many of the moves feel insecure to the uninitiated, as they work bulges with rough smearing and odd-angled holds, but this makes Castle Hill a good place to work on technique, and it's quicker to get to than Mt Stuart.&nbsp;</p>

      </font>
      </b> Park in the lower carpark opposite the white restaurant and walk up the road for 30m until you hit the green Rotary "Adventure Trail" sign. Walk down the Adventure Trail to the R of the road ignoring all side-paths until you hit the railing on your L. Instead of continuing down at this point, break off L past the broken rock faces along a well worn track which leads to the start of the routes. This isn't the only way to get to the routes - you can walk up from below, or descend down the major gully from the very top of the central lookout.&nbsp;</p>

** Vision 70m 19</b><br>
A Castle Hill classic. A great climb to do in the afternoon. The route was rebolted in late 1998 to make it completely safe. Simply great climbing with excellent positions up the top. Starts a few metres down R of TS. If you can't find TS, walk past the bouldering wall, keeping an eye out for a wide chimney (landmark) up through the grass on your L. Continue past this for a few metres, keeping on the track until you hit the (overall) third railing on the track. Once here, punch up the hill through the grass for 10m (no track) to the base of the blunt ar�te of the large, slightly detached block that is the start of the climb. You'll know you're on track if you see a series of big, silver 90 degree FHs quite close together up the face.

      <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
1) 20m (18) A fairly tricky lead because the moves feel insecure. To start, climb up easily to clip the first FH. Cruxy moves through the second and third FHs will have you thinking. Keep going up past FHs until you reach the crack (medium wires) where the climb eases. Up to tree belay or back to the chains behind the tree. Escape off L (chains) is possible here, but keep climbing because the next pitches are better.
      <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
<img border="0" src="../sport.gif" width="14" height="12">  2) 15m (16) From the DBB behind the tree, step up onto the cheat stone and sidle L onto the thin face to clip first FH. Sweet moves past thin stuff interspersed with two thank-you-God, finger-engulfing jugs will lead you past the second and third FHs to the massive, exposed slab with fantastic views, easy moves and good bolts. Keep it
      goin' on until you run into the ledge and DBB. A great pitch. You can scramble off L here if needed.
      <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><img border="0" src="../sport.gif" width="14" height="12">
      3) 30m (19) You'll need about 12 draws for this pitch. From the DBB, traverse R and up to clip the FH. Keep traversing R to clip another FH in a very photogenic position (some climbers choose to now traverse back and clean the first FH to reduce rope drag). From here it's up and R clipping bolts into the corner. Now cruxy and quite sustained moves up the pocketed corner to the top where some manky bolts belonging to 'Rusty Bolts' can be found along with the chains for this climb, about 4m back from the edge.<br>

** Transmogrifier 115m 18<br>
</b>
1) 45m (crux) Starts 2m R of COA, R of the tree at the far L of the Hardman Wall. You'll need 5 hangers and
      14 draws for this pitch in addition to gear for the bolted belay stations. Bridge
      up using the tree, then move R into the groove with optional cam slot (creates rope drag). Continue following line of bolts
      tending R up slab and steep headwall to chains.<br>
2) 30m (17) From chains traverse up and right 7m to first FH, hard moves past next two FHs to thin crack. Follow this to
      chains on hollow ledge.<br>
3) 40m (16) Obvious crack up steep wall till it trends R. Follow this on natural gear to join up with S&amp;S for the last few
      BRs. Climbs the wall L of the majot groove L of the Saint. DBB (need hangers).<br>

10m L (when looking at the main wall) of the rock with the plaque on it are two large boulders on the R-hand side of the path. The largest of these has
some bouldering on its overhanging facet. V1 up the R arete, V3/4 starting under the overhang on the L-hand

115m 21<br>
</b>
"Saint" for obvious reasons, and "Sinner" because of the bolts - a plethora of
puny 10mm dynabolts which means the route will need to be rebolted earlier than
if it was done properly. Nevertheless, a great achievement. There are four rap stations on the route and about 50 bolts. You'll need about 14 quickdraws and five bolt brackets. It starts on the far R of Hardman Wall
uphill and R of the spiky pandanus tree (the direct start starts to the L of the tree).&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">1) 27m (21) This pitch has 12 bolts and goes up some sustained territory with the crux above the 9th bolt. A real endurance-fest. Starting R of the tree, up to ledge, then L onto face and up following bolts (the DS

a similar grade).&nbsp;</p>

From the above route, keep walking R (around the corner). This leads you to another big-ass wall which forms the L wall of the major gully that splits Castle Hill in two. In the approximate middle of this wall, about 25m up is a rap station with two white slings hanging off the bolts. This is the belay/rap station for the aid route discussed below.&nbsp;<br>
</i>
<br>
<b>
Aid Route 25m M4+<br>
</b>
On this L gully wall there are a couple of white streaks running down the wall. The L-most white streak up a water scoop is the first pitch of an aid climb. Rusty thin bolts, rusty pitons and 316 stainless rivets run up the climb. The climb goes to the rap chains and beyond another couple of pitches. Need multiple birdbeaks, hooks, RURPs, thin nailing gear, pitons, rivets, a hand drill and other stuff.
This was an unfinished aid route from long ago, but was aided onsight by Monsieur Beaulieu Jean-Louise.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<b>
Corner Route 35-40m 17-20?&nbsp;<br>
</b>
Starts on the L wall of the major gully about halfway up, about 30m right of the aid route. It's the most obvious line on the wall, so I'd be very surprised if it hadn't been climbed before, however there are no markings at the base. Take some big gear and a helmet for the second. You could walk off the top, or take two ropes for a double rope rap off the fig tree.&nbsp;

You can access the very top of the Funky Slabs (discussed below) by walking across the terrace from this corner route. 15m right of the corner route is a weakness. It's a seam/corner that would need to be bolted. Would make a fairly tasty hard route. Starts at the fig tree growing out of the rock.&nbsp;<br>
</i>
<br>

From the corner route, walk down to the bottom of the gully and follow the rock R (looking at the rock) for about 10-20m to come across the Funky Slabs where the next climbs are located.&nbsp;<br>

<b>Sne 20m 13-16?<br>
</b>Faintly marked. The first route on the Funky Slabs. Starts 20m R of the gully and heads up the nice-looking orange slab between two black streaks. I can't see any pro whatsoever. I think you could finish this one by walking off left down the major gully, or alternately you could perhaps finish this one by falling off.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<b>Dutch Igloo 20m 13-16?<br>
</b>
Faintly marked.
Starts 2m right of S at base of the R-curving mini-corner on clean slab. Climbs up the slab just L of mini-corner to the first bolt at about 10m, then more slab. May be some protectable pockets on the slab. Probably finishes as per FF.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<b>
Flexing Flakes 25m 15<br>
</b>
Faintly marked, but extremely hard to see the paint. A fairly scary lead. Starts 2m R of DI and heads up the orange slab to below the curving mini-corner (possible pro). Then straight over the overlap and up the slab for a few metres on flexing flakes to a thin rusty bolt. Up slab for about 8m to another bolt. Up slab (cams) to big break below headwall. Through easiest section of this to big ledge (natural pro belay). Walk off down gully.&nbsp;

An ANZAC day memorial climb. Starts 5m R of FF. Well protected if you take a full rack of cams &amp; some small wires. Up slab for 2.5m to single pocket. Run it out easily to stance &amp; first FH. A couple of tricky slab moves lead up to the second FH. From here, up &amp; slightly R to pocket (small wire). Another few moves above this to pocket. Now big runout up easy slab to below overhang.

            Slab route up nice-looking crystally rock. May have some gear a few
            metres off the deck, but then nothing until right up the top. I don't
            know what to do when you reach the top. Maybe a walk off L and then
            a tree rap. Not sure.&nbsp;<br>

            <i> I haven't found any routes on the slab under the main roof (about

            of grass and dirt and scratchy stuff. It is a good slab though (albeit
            easy). It has these cool looking football sized holes in it.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            Above the main roofs somewhere there is a set (or maybe more than
            one set) of chains. They may or may not relate to a five pitch project

            Easy slab up to the corner. The 5m corner would be the crux, on bomber
            med-large hexes and cams. Set of FH's at the end, which is part of
            a line which is yet to have the crux pitch freed. </p>

<a href="mailto:madoc.sheehan@jcu.edu.au"> madoc.sheehan@jcu.edu.au</a>&nbsp;<br>
<br>
This boulder can be found on the back side (facing Mt Stuart) of Castle Hill.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Easily accessed from the end of Skully St which is off Knapp St. Park where the dirt track/road begins. From the parking area and looking up at Castle Hill walk 10m to a trail and follow this right for 40m to the other side of the creek (cross the rusty pole..oooohhh). From the other side of the creek turn left and follow the rock slabs past the "peaces" boulders. Either walk up the left or right hand creek drainage for about 3 mins until it is possible to scramble up slabs between the two drainages. At the top of these slabs you will see the large boulder off to the right (it actually lies in the right-hand creek drainage). It will be obvious when you find it. All up it should only take 5-10 mins from the parking area.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Good problems include a fine overhanging V2/3 traverse about 10m long on big jugs. There are also many good steep up problems from V0 to potential Vhorrible. Check out the left hand ar�te (V0, V1 and V2) and the gully on the right (3 V0's (1 done by Sarah Sheehan) and 2 V0's on adjoining boulder (also done by Sarah Sheehan). A fine excursion through the middle of the wall (obvious) awaits an injection of courage and strength. The landings are quite reasonable although a spotter would usually be appreciated. Shady in the afternoons.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<i>
Well, so far that's all the climbs I have seen on Castle Hill. Although I climbed here regularly in 1997 and 1998, most of the info on this page came from about five visits. My aim was to gather as much information as possible, organise it, and make it available to the climbing community.
Doug Hockly incorporated this information into the Townsville&nbsp; Climbing
Guide in 1999, and so now that is available. Hopefully someone will see this page and mail me with updates about first
ascentionists, old routes, new routes, whatever. I wouldn't be surprised if the old bolters want to remain anonymous,
but I certainly would like the historical info.</i>

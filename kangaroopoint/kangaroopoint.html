<p align="left"><b>INTRODUCTION</b><br>
Kangaroo Point is Brisbane's outdoor climbing gym. It is probably one of the most
user-friendly crags around, with gigantic concrete bollards at the top of the 20m high cliff face for setting up anchors. Perfectly flat grass awaits your bouldering falls. Barbeques lay in ready for your post(and pre?)-climb feast. Night lights allow you to climb into the wee hours of the morning. The river awaits your...hmm...actually, don't worry about the river. Caked-on chalk, climbers on top-ropes
galore, a few chipped holds and bolts, bolts, bolts. Get it into ya!</p>

      <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><b>ACCESS</b><br>
      Kangaroo Point is located right on the Brisbane river in the suburb of (fittingly) Kangaroo Point. If you are in Brisbane, you really can't miss it. If you do, perhaps you should quit climbing. Ahh what the hell,
      <a href="kpmap.jpg"> have a look at this map</a> I swiped from the UQ climbing page. If you are carless, you can catch the train in and get off at Vulture Street station and walk for 5-10 mins.<br>
      <br>
      <b>WHEN TO GO</b></p>
      <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"> Winter is fine pretty much all the
      time, but if you go during the day in summer, you will die. Seriously though, the rock is too hot to climb on, you'll set your hands on fire.
      The only sane time to climb is early in the morning, or from late
      afternoon into the evening. Lights mean you can climb until about 2-3am or so. Very
      convenient. If you don't get there early though, top ropes will be set up on the best
      routes.</td>

      Because almost every square metre of Kangaroo Point is utilised, the
      routes are of widely varying quality. The crag is most popular with top
      roping beginners who do low quality routes in the 14-17 bracket. Most of
      the better climbing is found on grade 20+ routes. The rock is Volcanic Tuff (like Smith Rocks in the States) - check some of the pics on the
      <a href="../../galleries/kangaroopoint/kangaroopoint.html"> Kangaroo Point Climbing Gallery</a> to see what it's like. The majority of routes are bolted face climbs. There are a few cracks around, but they are
      rare, and not particularly inspiring. Generally, the rock has a quarried texture and is often sandy. There are probably over 250 routes graded from 3-26.

      <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><b>GUIDEBOOK</b><br>
        The most current guidebook (2003) is that by Darrin Carter, which is a 
        re-worked version of Neil Monteith's 1997 guide. Grab a copy from Height 
        Dynamics, or any of the Valley climbing stores.

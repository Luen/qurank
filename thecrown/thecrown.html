<p>For those of you who are yet to visit the thriving metropolis of Urbenville, you will find it about 14km from Woodenbong and Woodenbong is the first cockroach-haven south of the border on the Mt
Lindesay Highway (which turns into the Summerland Way).</p>
<p><b>Directions</b><br>
To get to the Toolum Falls campground, head through Urbenville on the main street
(Urben Street). Continue on this road out of town for two to three
kilometres. Turn L at sign for Toolum Falls (dirt road). Continue to end of road. There are pit toilets, but no tap water. Click here for a view of the waterfall at the campground.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><font color="#FF0000">Access Update (2009)</font></strong><br>
It is requested (by the farmer whose land you cross to access the cliff) that you phone him prior to your arrival and seek permission to access The Crown. His name is Mr Jones and his number is (02) 6634 1225. Think of this as a courtesy call which will serve to keep climbers in the good graces of land managers. Please do it. If you should have any problems with this arrangement, post up on qurank.com. </p>
<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="85%" rowspan="2">
When on the main street of Urbenville (Urben Street), take Stephen Street out of town and over small bridge. Turn L into Sewerage Treatment Works. Once the car has been safely parked, head up the grass slope to the two 'apple trees'. Once at the tree line follow the ridge up - if you're lucky you may even find a track. Once you're quite high on the ridge, contour to the R until you arrive at the base of the cliff. The walk takes 20-25 minutes.&nbsp;</td>

If you managed to follow the correct track you will have hit the cliff just
before the first climb listed. The climbs are mainly on slabs, with the majority of protection being bolts (usually too many). Most require hangers and
most are non-stainless steel so are rusty - take care. Almost all routes are soft touches at the grade.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Rebolting Update (2008)</strong><br>
  Thanks to a coalition of the willing representing QUT Cliffhangers and Safer Cliffs Queensland, there has been significant rebolting of the popular slab routes. </p>

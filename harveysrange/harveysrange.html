          <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Rock 
            and lots of it. The most developed area is the Harvey's Marbles bouldering 
            area. As for the other areas, I can't tell you much about specifics 
            - this guide is purely intended to whet your appetite. The access 
            is pretty bad (long treks) for most areas, and I bet a lot of it is 
            virtually unexplored. There would be hundreds of superb epic trad 
            routes just waiting to be done. There has been a little development 
            around Harvey's Range, but I only have info about a few routes.</font>

          Much more has been happening here in recent years (2004-2006). See the <a href="http://www.thecrag.com/cgi-bin/index.cgi?node=17324&resource=-&tab=navigate&offset=1&gsystem=AU&">theCrag.com route database</a>.</font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>

- This place is easy to find, because it's the best looking rock, closest to the
        road on the drive out there. Drive out on Harvey Range Rd and just keep going past the turn offs for the above areas. Continue west of Townsville until the road starts to
        elevate. When the road starts to elevate, you're getting close. Simply keep driving for about 1-2km on the slight incline until you see the large rocky outcrop on the left. That's your goal. If the road begins a large sweeping turn, you've gone too far.<br>
        <br>
        <b>2-3 pitch grade 22/23</b><br>
Park the car on the right hand side (looking uphill) of the road at the obvious spot and then walk back down the hill on the right hand side (looking downhill). Stop when you come across an
orangey-brown bedrock washout. Step over the guide-rail and go down there, if it's the right one, there'll be pipes you could walk through taking you under the highway.<br>
Anyway, start your uphill trek from this washout/creek thingy. Follow it up towards to outcrop. About 15 people (as at Sept '97) have made the walk up there so there is a bit of a track. Also, you may see bits of white tape around some of the trees to guide you.<br>
<br>
As to the route, it is all natural and was apparently established in the mid
        90's by Scott Johnson of Mt Stuart fame. It was attempted in 1997 by Nathan Bolton and Brad Mann and the
very crappy pictures below might give you some idea.</font></p>

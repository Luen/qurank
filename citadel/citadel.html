<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">A newly "discovered" area which saw some development in August 1998. Adventure awaits those with drive and enthusiasm. The Citadel is located within the boundary of Lumholtz National Park. It is a massive National Park (over 110 000 hectares) and this cliff is a long way from nowhere, but it is probably best not to arouse suspicions of climbing in the area. The National Park Authorities might not like it, but due to the remoteness from established walking trails and such, I assume it's probably okay. However, better to be safe than sorry, so keep it quiet. There are no facilities, so take everything you need. Also, avoid littering.</p>

      The area is located between Ingham and Cardwell. It is 29 km S of Cardwell and 21km N of Ingham. This makes it 140 km (1.5 hours) N of Townsville. Not that far to drive, and still very day-tripable. When travelling N, you are starting to get close when you drive up the range and there is the lookout over Hinchinbrook on your R. Keep driving - it's less than 10 minutes from here. Keep an eye on the L side of the road for the rocky outcrop (as pictured). Make sure you have the correct outcrop (not the one to the S which looks like twin pillars). Don't worry, the large walls are impossible to miss. Slow down just after "Waterfall Creek" and find the small track leading L off the highway. If you hit "Fishers Creek" you have gone too far. Drive in 10m to hide the car a bit and park before the railway tracks. Now it's a 30 minute bushwalk directly up to the crag.</td>

<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">The rock quality and climbing style is somewhat reminiscent of the Glasshouse Mountains. Just like on Tibro and Beerwah, there are big, naturally protected routes. These can be loose in places, but are quite exposed and have sweeping views of Hinchinbrook. Like Ngungun, there are shorter, higher-quality routes,
protected by a mixture of bolts and natural gear. In addition, many large boulders scatter the area and there are some good problems to be done.</p>

<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><b>CAMPING</b><br>
Camping is permitted at The Citadel because it lies within the National Park, so if you can find a flat spot, go
for it. However, do not light fires - use stoves instead. Lighting fires in the National Park would be a good way to get the crag shut down quickly, so please don't do it.</p>

<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Ethics vary from area to area, and The Citadel is no exception. Keep in mind The Citadel is an adventure crag, not a consumer-friendly sport crag. Be mindful of the vegetation - no chopping trees and such. Leave vegetation on the cliff unless it directly interferes with a route, in which case remove it entirely. Do not mark routes with paint. It goes without saying to not chip holds or retrobolt. Do not put up bolt ladder sport routes - this is not the place for it. Let new routes follow natural lines and only use bolts where natural protection is unavailable. If bolts are used, use only
stainless expansion bolts or glue-in carrots and paint hangers to blend in with the rock. Do not leave any loose rock or other mobile objects on new routes.</p>

<b>ROUTE GUIDE</b></p>

<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><i>If you walk up to the crag the obvious way (heading for the middle of the cliff), you will probably arrive at what feels like the middle, but is actually around the middle-left of the crag. This area is marked by a huge, black corner (Carborundum Central) and makes a good base camp.<br>
</i><br>
<i>Now that you're at the cliff, the routes will be described from L to R<br>
</i><br>
<i>On the far L of the cliff there is a large boulder with a few potential routes on it including a 2m roof split by a finger-width crack. One route on this boulder has been top-roped.</i><br>
<br>
<b>Unclimbed overhang arête route 7m 20?<br>
</b>Fantastic photo op. On the L of the seaward side of the boulder and a couple of metres L of
Twin Paranoia. About 2 bolts required up the short scooped face and overhanging blunt
arête.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<b>Twin Paranoia 7m 16-19<br>
</b>Again, great photo op. On the seaward side of the boulder, climb the L-leaning twin cracks (R-one wide, L-one thin) L of the overhang to the top. Natural pro and tree belay.<br>
FTRA: Steve Baskerville &amp; Jason Shaw 1/8/98.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<b>Unclimbed arête route ~13m<br>
</b>About 7m R of Double Exposure. Up pitted arête (2 bolts needed) to below 2m roof. A variety of options now exist. Step easily R to escape up slabby wall (easy) or step L beneath roof and attempt finger crack through roof (stoopidly hard).&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<b>Unclimbed easy route 10-13m 4?<br>
</b>Easy peasy. About 3m R of the arête route. Easily up twin, wide, slabby cracks, then runout up slab to top and probable tree belay.&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><i>Beneath this boulder on the seaward side (but facing Ingham), is a 10-15m high, very easy-angled scooped slab. The angle makes it scary to solo up,
but this could be good for honing your slab skills on top rope.</i></p>

<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><br>
<i>Now way back down R. About 30m L of Carborundum Central (the big black corner) is a very large boulder about 20m off the ground that forms a 3m roof with an obvious offwidth running through the roof. This is unclimbed (any takers?), but makes a good landmark.</i></p>

<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><br>
<b>Corner-crack project 8m 15?<br>
</b>Starts a few metres L of the boulder-roof at the large, recessed, slabby corner-crack. Steve has led this to about 5m and Lee has soloed up to around the same point. The crux is getting up to the tree. Finish at tree.<br>
Project: Steve Baskerville 1/8/98.&nbsp;</p>

      <img border="0" src="../danger.gif" width="15" height="15"> 1) 17m 15. Not technically hard, but psychologically demanding. A fall on the middle of this pitch could have serious consequences. Up to scabby, vine-covered start ledge. Climb corner past small tree. Now it begins: up the slabby, black corner with dodgy micro-wires to the thank-god hand crack and good gear. Now up until level with vegetated ledge on L. The obvious line continues straight up, but the rock is poor and the climbing hard. Instead, escape off L onto ledge and up into large orange cave to belay (cave not visible from ground level).&nbsp;<br>
      2) 23m 16. This pitch gets better as you climb. L out of cave and up ledge through grass and trees to get established in obvious chimney/corner with chockstones up high (almost better to belay this next bit from here if possible). Up this with good gear and cruxy moves around the chockstones to a tree and natural pro belay. Rap off tree with double ropes, or do more pitches, as there is like 60+ metres of rock from here to the summit.&nbsp;<br>

route to bolt The Dark Crystal, and is not really recommended.<br>
<img border="0" src="../danger.gif" width="15" height="15"> 1) 15m 19 A1. A dangerous pitch. Start at
tree belay on top of sloping ledge 15-20m up. Your aim is to get into the
vegetated corner-crack and through the roof any way you can. Ooze R-wards around
arête and onto face. Micro-wires here, and move up and R to incut on small
sloping ledge a few metres L of vegetated corner. Grab hold on face above and
fearfully mantle sloping ledge. Sidle delicately R into the vegetated
corner-crack and bomber big cams. Now through roof (freeable, but aided by first
ascentionist) and then up wide corner-crack above to sloping ledge.&nbsp;<br>
2) 15m 1. For the grade, this pitch is great. A walk with monster exposure!
Traverse R and then around the corner on the 1m wide sloping ledge. There is
good protection at your feet. The pitch finishes with a 2.5m high layback crack
which is about grade 10, but I always wanted to grade something grade 1. Tree
belay, and then double rope rap off tree down The Dark Crystal buttress to
ground.&nbsp;<br>
